# Command Line Heroes: The Game
Command Line Heroes: The Game is a brand new open source an adventure game that was announced on Season 2 -
[Episode 1](https://www.redhat.com/en/command-line-heroes/season-2/press-start) of the Command Line Heroes
[Podcast](https://www.redhat.com/en/command-line-heroes). The game will be created using our own
[Hero Engine](https://github.com/CommandLineHeroes/hero-engine) which we are working on first.

Right now this repo is just a placeholder until we get the engine to a point where we can start building the game.
Check out the [hero-engine](https://github.com/CommandLineHeroes/hero-engine) if you want to contribute!
