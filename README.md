You are an intern in NASA's Jet Propulsion Labs specializing in AI and machine learning. You are experimenting with new technology that will transfer of human consciousness into a robot to control it over long distances. However, something goes terribly wrong and your consciousness is trapped on the ship after take-off. You must help the crew survive and thrive in humankind's first extraterrestrial settlement. Interface with the ship's computers from within by learning one of the most powerful tools available: The Command Line.
